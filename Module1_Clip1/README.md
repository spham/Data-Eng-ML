# Module 1, Clip 1: Data Profiling

This module demonstrates automated data profiling techniques using the `ydata-profiling` library.

## Files

- `data_profiling.py`: Main script for generating data profile reports
- `tips_profile.html`: Generated HTML report of the tips dataset

## What You'll Learn

- How to perform automated data quality assessment
- Understanding data distributions and patterns
- Identifying missing values and outliers
- Generating comprehensive data reports

## Key Concepts

### Data Profiling
Data profiling is the process of examining data to understand its structure, content, and quality. The `ydata-profiling` library automates this process by generating detailed reports that include:

- **Dataset Overview**: Basic statistics and information
- **Variable Analysis**: Individual column analysis
- **Correlations**: Relationships between variables
- **Missing Values**: Identification and patterns
- **Sample Data**: Preview of actual data

## Usage

```bash
python data_profiling.py
```

This script will:
1. Load the tips dataset from seaborn
2. Generate a comprehensive profile report
3. Save the report as an HTML file

## Output

The script generates `tips_profile.html` which contains:
- Interactive data visualizations
- Statistical summaries
- Data quality metrics
- Correlation matrices
- Missing value analysis

## Dependencies

- `pandas`: Data manipulation
- `ydata-profiling`: Automated data profiling
- `seaborn`: Sample dataset (tips)

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you'll understand:
- How to assess data quality automatically
- The importance of data profiling in ML workflows
- How to interpret profiling reports
- Best practices for data exploration
